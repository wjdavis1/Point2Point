# Point2Point Improvements

## Initial Recommit Date: 06/09/2018 ##

## Description ##

This was initially a project completed in SER316 as a means to learn about how to improve
and work on legacy code.
The improvements that are done in this project are not part of that project, and a are
done independently of the class.

## Improvement Ideas ##

This project was based off of an old project Called Memoranda. Some if not many of the improvements that are found here were done within the class semester.

### Ideas ###

** Using MVC **
Separate a lot of the object coupling and work to follow the MVC design paradigm. A lot of data objects and forms are tightly coupled together and need to be reformatted or re-worked for performance.

** Implementation of Panels **

Some Panels were not properly implemented in the time of the different Sprints. Due to this there are some parts of the program that are not working properly or not implemented at all.

** GUI Fixes **

Fix spacing issues in some of the GUI forms and make it work properly 

** Overall Improvements **

Any new ideas or improvements that can be found will be implemented or worked into the project as soon as possible or as needed.
